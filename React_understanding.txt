How react works?


for web development react we need webpack.inside this web pack we will mention the needfull things to work react.
when we run the command "npm start" or "yarn start",the "start" is a alias for "react-scripts start"
it will look for the "start.js" file inside "react-scripts" inside "node modules".
in "path.js" inside "config" we given the details of "index.html" and "index.js" as "appHtml" and "appIndexJs" respectievly.
we are using this "path.js" inside the "start.js" and running the "index.js".
inside the "index.js" using reactdom we are creating a DOM root as the "root" element as div located in "index.html" with div id "root".
all other dom elements that are created in our react application will be the childrens of this dom element "root".
inside the "index.js" we are mentioning the "app.js" as a component, inside "app.js" only we are embedding all our components and it goes on like a chain.
so after creating a root dom ,the program flow will go into app.js and the components inside app.js.


why react?


React is a javascript libarary used to build client side application.
Reusable component makes react more advanced when comparing to html and js.
State management.
when there is a change in the dom , react only updates the new parts compared to the old virtual dom.then only it will make the changes into the real dom.
this will improve the performance.this is achieved by diffing algorithm.
JSX allows to write html inside javascript.
react is open source ,so lot of developers will contribute new functionalities to it.it will help other developers to do the work effective and efficient.
