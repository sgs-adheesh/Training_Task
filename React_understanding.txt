How react works?

when we run the command npm start or yarn start.Start is a alias for "react-scripts start"
it will look for the start.js file inside react-scripts inside node modules.
in path.js inside config we given the details of index.html and index.js as appHtml and appIndexJs respectievly.
we are using this path.js inside the start.js and running the index.js.
inside the index.js using reactdom we are creating a DOM root as the root element as div located in index.html with div id root.
all other dom elements that are created in our react application will be the childrens of this dom element root.
inside the index.js we are mentioning the app.js as a component, inside app.js only we are embedding all our components and it goes on like a chain.
so after creating a root dom ,the program flow will go into app.js and the components inside app.js.


why react?
