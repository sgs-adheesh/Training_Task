profitlab

this is a software that targeting on fine dine restaurants.

those restaurants have an average margine of 5-10%. sothis is not a stable one.inorder to attain a stable margin and 
avoid loss this software will be usefull.

the things that affect restaurant
1.raw materials
2.menu
3.pos
4.

this software acts as a bridge between vendors and restaurant owners
one restaurant giving the monthly expenses bills to profitlab ,and profitlab comes to know the each expenses separately and 
identify where the expense going high and low
ie,suppose a raw material cost getting high due to less availability,so the usage of that raw material should be reduced.
if a raw material cost getting low due to more avaialability,so it can be efficiently used


from menu,it will only take the most selling items.ie, only analysing the most sellin items

before profitlab

it is hard to know which things causing the cost high from a list of items
inorder to reduce the cost we dont know which raw material or which vendor should be choose

after profitlab

it will give the cost of each raw material that we are using and difference in the price compared to previous month
profit lab can guide the rest owner to find the better vendor for maintain the profit
if somehing get high cost then owners would know that the items cretaed using this materials should have to limit
